I identify six significant predictors based on my analysis.

**Model Limitation**
The limitation of this logistic regressino model includes the following: - I cannot do extrapolation for prediction that is our of the range that I use to form the logistic regression model. - The predictability of this model is relatively week as most p-values are quite large. - The predictability is subject to the choice of threshold.
